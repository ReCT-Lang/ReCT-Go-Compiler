# ReCT Lexer
Since we are working with ReCT 1.0/1.1 I'll summarise the Lexical Tokens here.

## Tokens

**keywords** var to set if else while true false for from function int string return

**Operators** + - / * ! <- = != ++ -- <-+ <-- <-/ <-* | || & &&

**Other**: ( ) { } ; "

## Current implementation
I made a very quick lexer feel free to modify it / make it better. - Tokorv  
  
Added some more tokens. Also removed the Print keyword as its just an Identifier. - RedCube
